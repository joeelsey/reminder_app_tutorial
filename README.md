# reminder_app_tutorial
Another excuse to dive into ember.  This time with node and twilio.

This is the url for the first part of the tutorial.  I don't neccessarily like everything
being done in this tutorial, so I'm adjusting certain parts to work the way I want.  We'll
see if that's a good or a bad thing.
