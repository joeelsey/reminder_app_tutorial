# reminder_app_tutorial
Another excuse to dive into ember.  This time with node and twilio.

http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/tutorials/build-a-reminder-app-with-node-js-and-ember-js-part-1/

This is the url for the first part of the tutorial.  I don't neccessarily like everything
being done in this tutorial, so I'm adjusting certain parts to work the way I want.  We'll
see if that's a good or a bad thing.

Edit:  So far I have the basic functionality of the app.  I can create a message and have twilio text my cell phone.  I'm currently writing back end tests for the tutorial.
